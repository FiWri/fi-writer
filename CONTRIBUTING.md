# Contributing to Transcriptase

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github

We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We use [Trunk based-development](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/), and all code changes happen through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (see some  on [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-pull-request-on-github)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `trunk`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. Ensure the test suite passes.
4. Make sure your code lints.
5. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the GNU Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [GNU 3.0 License](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-3.0/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/FiWri/fi-writer/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

[This is an example](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626) of a bug report I wrote, and I think it's not a bad model. Here's [another example from Craig Hockenberry](http://www.openradar.me/11905408), an app developer whom I greatly respect.

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can. [My stackoverflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626) includes sample code that *anyone* with a base R setup can run to reproduce what I was seeing
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

This should be a breeze. You have prettier and eslint setup in this repository. You still need to look how the project is written and try to write in a style consistent with that, but at least formatting should not be an issue.

- You can try running `npm run lint` for style unification

## Help

You have a wiki available [here](https://github.com/FiWri/fi-writer/wiki) if you don't know where to start or need any help with the project.
