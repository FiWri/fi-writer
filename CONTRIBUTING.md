# Contributing to Fi-Writer

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github

We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We use Discord for communication

The [discord server](https://discord.gg/TCCbb5qFC8) is used both for development and communicating with the application users. There is a [specific channel](https://discord.com/channels/966586970966986762/966587028990988329) to talk about Fi-Writer development.

## We use [Zenhub](https://www.zenhub.com/) for project management

Zenhub is a project management tool that integrates seamlessly with Github issues for project management. It even has a [browser extension](https://www.zenhub.com/extension) for Chrome and Firefox to show Zenhub as a tab directly in the Github repository.

Release are a group of long term goals that will justify realeasing a new version of the software.
Epics are long term goals, made of smaller tasks.
Tasks are short term goals, the basis of our work. They need to allow us to have a clear picture of a specific task, and it should be manageable in a short amount of time. It can be divided in subtasks if you realize the complexity is bigger than you thought.

## We use [Trunk based-development](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/), and all code changes happen through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (see some  on [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-pull-request-on-github)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `trunk`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. Ensure the test suite passes.
4. Make sure your code lints.
5. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the GNU Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [GNU 3.0 License](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-3.0/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/FiWri/fi-writer/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/FiWri/fi-writer/issues); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

This should be a breeze. You have prettier and eslint setup in this repository. You still need to look how the project is written and try to write in a style consistent with that, but at least formatting should not be an issue.

- You can try running `npm run lint` for style unification

## Help

You have a wiki available [here](https://github.com/FiWri/fi-writer/wiki) if you don't know where to start or need any help with the project.
